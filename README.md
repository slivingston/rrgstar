Rapidly-exploring random graphs library
=======================================

References
----------

We provide here implementations of RRG [1] and the optimal extension [2] for
motion planning subject to deterministic μ-Calculus constraints. The latter
paper makes use of important results from [3]. The implementation includes
corrections to and missing details from [2].

Compiling examples, documentation
---------------------------------

The usual [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) idiom,

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..

On a standard UNIX platform, you can next run `make` to build all examples, the
programs for which will be under bin/.  To instead build a particular example,
call `make` with its name, e.g., to build only the rrg_dubins_car example,

    make rrg_dubins_car

To build the API manual,

    make doc

which requires [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) to be installed. The generated
files will be under the directory html/


Testing
-------

Current results of continuous integration (CI) testing:
[![build status on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/slivingston/rrgstar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slivingston/rrgstar)
[![build status on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ox4bjfaadrk22m05?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/slivingston/rrgstar)
Thanks to [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org) and [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com) for CI services.


Using rrglib
------------

The rrglib library consists primarily of header files and does not require
compilation a priori.  However, support is provided for installing header files
and libraries in a common location and against which other programs can
link. The default CMake install prefix can be changed by providing a value for
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. E.g., `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/opt ..` will use the
opt/ directory in your home directory instead of the system-wide /usr or
/usr/local.  HPP files will be placed under include/rrglib/ (after the install
prefix), and compiled object and CMake configuration files will be installed
under lib/rrglib/

For example, to use it in a CMakeLists.txt

    find_package (rrglib REQUIRED)
    include_directories (~/opt/include/rrglib)

    add_executable (rrgstar_double_integrator rrgstar_doubleinteg.cpp)
    target_link_libraries (rrgstar_double_integrator kdtree incmumc)

where incmumc is part of rrglib.  kdtree is not a part of rrglib (it originates
elsewhere) but is shipped with rrglib for convenience.


Visualizations, interfaces
--------------------------

Note that visualization is not intended to be the main purpose of this
repository, so Mayavi, Matplotlib, etc. as used in tools/rrgplot.py are regarded
as optional dependencies.  Similarly, building the various interfaces may
require external resources to be available, like ROS.  However, those
dependencies are only necessary if you want to build that particular interface.

The primary means for visualizing is `tools/rrgplot.py`. For 2D plotting it uses
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org), and for 3D plotting
[Mayavi](http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/). The former is part of [the
standard SciPy stack](http://www.scipy.org/about.html).


Examples
--------

After completing the installation instructions above, you can run examples and
plot the resulting trajectories. To use the RRG planner for Dubins car, from the
build/ directory, try

    bin/rrg_dubins_car > tmp.json
    ../tools/rrgplot.py ../examples/2d3r.json tmp.json

To use the RRG* planner for the same dynamics model (Dubins car),

    bin/rrgstar_dubins_car > tmp.json
    ../tools/rrgplot.py ../examples/2d3r.json tmp.json
